== Description ==
Simple JTAG programmer for FTDI FT245R [1], used in skoe's EasyFlash 3 [2].
Reads Serial Vector Format files (SVF) [3] and bit bangs the state transitions
into the FT245R.

== Requirements ==
gcc
libc6
libftdi [4]
libusb [5]

== Compilation ==
* If you have (GNU-) make installed simply execute make in the source directory.
* If you only have bash, run ./make.sh
* If you have neither type: gcc -Wall -lftdi -o easp easp.c

== Usage ==
easp [options] <svf file>
 options:
   -b <kbit/s> set bit rate
   -c disable verification of TDO outputs
   -d <device number> use FTDI device <number>
   -l list FTDI USB devices
   -p <product_id> use a different USB product ID
   -v verbose
   -h help

=== Programming EasyFlash3 firmware ===
# Connect it to the C64 expansion port and the USB port of your PC.
# Switch on the the C64.
# Then start easp with:
   ./easp -p 0x8738 -v <svf_file>
# When everything worked right, press the upper left button on the EF3 to
  reset to BASIC. You now can use EasyProg on the C64 to program the KERNAL
  and user cartridges.

=== Usage examples ===
# List all easyflash devices:
  ./easp -p 0x8738 -l

# Write SVF file to FT245R device 1:
  ./easp -p 0x6001 -d 1 file.svf

== Troubleshooting ==
* If you cannot access the FT245R because of missing permissions to open
  the USB device, on Debian derived systems it might help to create a new udev
  rule file (located in /etc/udev/rules.d) with the following content:
  --snip--
  SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="8738", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"
  --snap--
  and add your user account to the group plugdev. The group name may different
  in your operating system distribution.
  In older systems it might look like this:
  --snip--
  SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="8738", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"
  --snap--
